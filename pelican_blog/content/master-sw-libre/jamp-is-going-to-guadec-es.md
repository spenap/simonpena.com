The [application](http://gitorious.org/mswl2010/jamp) we've been
developing at the [Desktop &
Mobile](http://www.mastersoftwarelibre.com/?page_id=273) module in the
Master has been accepted for a talk in the GUADEC-ES!

More info on that soon, but you can start by checking [the
program](http://2010.guadec.es/guadec/programa). Or even better: why
don't you [register](http://2010.guadec.es/guadec/registro) and visit
us?
