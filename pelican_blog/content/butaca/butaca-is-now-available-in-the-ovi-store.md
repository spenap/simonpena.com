After having improved the movie showtimes support and updated the UI so
it aligns better with the [Swipe UX](http://swipe.nokia.com/), this
Saturday I submitted Butaca to the Ovi Store. Yesterday (yes, that
quickly!) I got a notification that it had been accepted. I'm really
satisfied with this release: I use the application myself a lot, and
it's great to be able to check which movies are playing on the cinemas
and later review their details and the crew's.

I've uploaded a [screencast to
Youtube](http://youtu.be/FCrAmmd-GcQ "MeeGo / Harmattan applications: Butaca 0.3.5 screencast"),
displaying how the application works, and -as usual-
[screenshots](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bulfaiter/sets/72157627637415158/detail/ "Butaca Harmattan v0.3.5")
are available at my Flickr gallery. You can also review the [release
details](https://projects.developer.nokia.com/butaca/discussion/topic/7 "Butaca 0.3.5 released")
at the project page (where you'll be able to file bugs or get support as
well).

If you wonder what's to come next, here's some insight:

-   Localization
-   Check for extras after and during the credits (now that I have an
    API available for that)
-   Offline mode / better data caching
-   Embed trailer playback in the application
-   UI improvements
