A month ago, on November 5th, I was invited to deliver a talk at the
[Instituto Español Vicente
Cañada-Blanch](http://www.educacion.gob.es/exterior/centros/canadablanch/es/home/index.shtml),
in Portobello, London, to a dozen 14-years old Galician language
students.

The "Instituto Español Vicente Cañada-Blanch" is an Spanish school
originally opened in Greenwich in 1972, later moved to Portobello in
1982, providing education to the children of Spanish migrants living in
London. They have been teaching Galician since the 90s, since Portobello
was a preferred location for Galician expats.

During the last three years, Xaime Varela, Galician teacher, invites
people from Galicia to talk to his students, either about their jobs or
their profiles. He reached me after I joined one of the several Facebook
groups for Galician expats in the United Kingdom, so I proposed a talk
about  ["Software e Hardware Libre nun mundo
intelixente"](http://galegoenlondres.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/de-hardware-e-software-libres-en-galego.html).
I imagine he was a bit scared at the beginning: "they are only 14 years
old!"-, but he was OK as soon as I explained I would adapt the contents
to their age.

At Samsung they also liked the idea a lot, allowing me to take the day
off on business travel, and handing out some freebies for the students.

So that was it: I could talk during about 45 minutes about
Pontedeume -my home town-, A Coruña, Finland, cooking recipes (there is
a clear resemblance between accessing source code in software and
accessing some special recipe, in order to improve them), about
collaborating via Internet... I also explained how mostly every device
nowadays, from TVs to phones or tablets, has a certain amount of Free
Software on it.

It was very satisfying: the students are amazing and talkative, were
very interested, and made some very nice questions. They were delighted
with the [One Laptop Per Child](http://one.laptop.org/) project (they
could try a prototype that Mario had lend me), were almost shocked about
the endless possibilities of the 3D printers (like this [father that
built a low-cost prosthetic hand for his
son](http://sploid.gizmodo.com/loving-father-built-a-prosthetic-hand-for-his-son-with-1458497349)),
and loved my friend Xulio Coira's  [Open Pipe](http://openpipe.cc/)
project.

All in all, it was a really nice experience that I can only recommend: I
would really love to keep doing this kind of "evangelism"! Thanks a lot
to Xaime for the opportunity and Samsung for the
support!
