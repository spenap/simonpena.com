It is amazing how fast time goes: it feels it was yesterday
when I wrote that I had started looking for a new job, and after some
time doing interviews, I joined
[Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/uk/ "Samsung Electronics") at their
[Research Center in the
UK](http://www.linkedin.com/company/samsung-electronics-research-institute "Samsung Electronics Research Institute").

It's been three months working here already, and things are going very
well. The work here at Samsung is really interesting, and I am part of a
team working on
[DTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television "Digital television"),
with a particular focus on the
[WebKitGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/ "The WebKitGTK+ Project") project. I
am (again!) surrounded by great developers, and I am already learning a
lot!

The worst part about moving abroad was packing everything, putting all
our belongings into boxes, and watching the empty space they left, but
the rest was quite easy. My girlfriend and I initially stayed in a
serviced apartment in
[Staines](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mariosp/sets/72157632676593701/with/8442044632/ "Staines-upon-Thames, UK")
(a town right next to London where Samsung has these research offices),
and we've just recently moved to
[Richmond](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_upon_Thames "Richmond"):
a really nice borough in London, still close by train to Staines, and
more convenient to enjoy all that London can offer (and it offers a
lot!). Besides, we are already bringing in all our stuff, so the new
place is already looking like a home!

I plan to write here in my blog about some of the things we are doing at
Samsung, but I will leave that for another post: in the meanwhile, you
can enjoy the picture :)
