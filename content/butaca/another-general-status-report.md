Some quick notes (the list of things which would deserve a full blog
entry for themselves just keeps growing...)

-   My manager (I don't like how "boss" sounds) retired last week.
    Although he visited us a couple of days more to spend some time with
    us, things will be, at least, different. We'll surely miss him.
-   I started working with [Grilo](http://live.gnome.org/Grilo) at
    [Igalia](http://www.igalia.com/), as the practicum work for the
    [Free Software Master](http://www.mastersoftwarelibre.com/). I've
    been assigned a challenging task: improve the bindings
    infrastructure. Currently I'm getting familiar with the project,
    reading the doc and playing with the examples: it looks really
    interesting!
-   Yesterday I received permissions to
    [upload](http://wiki.maemo.org/Uploading_to_Extras)
    [to](http://extras-cauldron.garage.maemo.org/HOWTO.html#how-to-prepare-and-upload-source-packages-for-build)
    extras-devel, so... [maevies &
    butaca-server](http://gitorious.org/butaca) are available now! Of
    course, all [said warnings](http://wiki.maemo.org/Extras-devel)
    about extras-devel still apply. In my case, it's about memory
    consumption: the backend doesn't free the objects exposed via DBus,
    so you have to kill it to get that done. It's a small footprint and
    all that, but it's not nice and of course not the way I want it:
    having it uploaded to extras will get me motivated to fix it :)
    (Sure, there will be other issues as well, and I'll set up the
    bugtracker as soon as possible)
-   I've started with the slides for the
    [JaMp](http://gitorious.org/mswl2010/jamp) talk at
    [GUADEC-ES](http://2010.guadec.es/guadec/programa). There's still
    time left, but with these things, you never know...
