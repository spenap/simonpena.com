Quick update on maevies status:

-   Movie posters are fetched from Internet
-   Google movies page is shown when 'now on theaters' is clicked
-   It is possible to search for stingers and extras after / during the
    credits on WATC (What's after the credits)
-   WATC wiki is shown when a WATC result is clicked

Pictures from this update have been uploaded to [maevies' picasa
