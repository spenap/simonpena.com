Today marks three weeks since I [started
working](http://www.igalia.com/nc/igalia-247/news/item/welcome-simon/)
at [Igalia](http://www.igalia.com). The experience is being amazing and
promises to remain so: [new
challenges](http://twitter.com/#!/spenap/statuses/9720219282968577),
[new technologies](http://www.igalia.com/work/) and [excellent
companions](http://www.igalia.com/igalia-247/). So much to learn!

(And I have only words of gratitude to my former colleagues at Fenosa:
thank you for all this time!)﻿
