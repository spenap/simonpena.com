I've just finished writing the slides for the
[JaMp](http://gitorious.org/mswl2010/jamp)'s talk at the
[GUADEC-ES](http://2010.guadec.es/guadec) :)

Maybe it's still a bit longer than it should, but hey!

So, if you want to know those issues we faced with
[JaMp](http://gitorious.org/mswl2010/jamp) (GObject signals, D-Bus -from
both C and Python sides-, and some notes about the Maemo port) come
visit us to the Computer Science Faculty at A Coruña on 23rd July -next
Friday- at 13:00. Grab the program
