My name is Simón Pena and I am a Software Engineer and Open Source
enthusiast from Galicia, a beautiful place in the northwest of Spain.

I am currently working at [Samsung](http://www.samsung.com/), where I
have worked in a number of projects for its DTV department. Some of
them have been Open Source, around [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/) /
[WebKitGTK+](http://webkitgtk.org/), and others were more commercial
in nature, around the integration of content from both Internet and
Broadcast sources.

In the past, I worked at [Igalia](http://www.igalia.com), where among
other projects, I participated in the development of Nokia's MeeGo /
Harmattan platform.

This blog started as a collection of personal annecdotes, later
evolved into a more professional diary, and currently is
half-abandoned. Who knows what might come next!
