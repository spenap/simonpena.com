[![Get Mahjong from the Nokia
Store](http://simonpena.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/mahjong-nokia-n9-2.jpg "Get Mahjong from the Nokia Store")](http://store.ovi.com/content/257391)

Last week, we got [Mahjong
Solitaire](http://store.ovi.com/content/257391 "Mahjong Solitaire") for
N9 finally published.

This has been a great opportunity to use QML in my daily work at
[Igalia](http://www.igalia.com "Igalia"), instead of using it simply for
the occasional hacking, such as
[Butaca](http://store.ovi.com/content/195876 "Butaca: Cinema Information")
or the [XKCD reader](http://store.ovi.com/content/205765 "XKCD Reader").

So far, comments in the Nokia Store have been really positive -although
some people seem to miss the classic theme from the Mahjongs available
back in Maemo. But not only the comments are positive: the application
is currently listed in the [first position of the Top Free
games](http://store.ovi.com/#/games?sortBy=mostPopular&contentArea=games&priceType=free "Top Free Games")!

Drop me a line (*spena at igalia.com*) if you find issues, you have
suggestions or if you simply want to complain about the colors
;)
