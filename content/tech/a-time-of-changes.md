I left my job at Igalia at the beginning of this month, after
a bit more than two years working there.

These past two years have been incredible: I was living in Finland for
almost the whole 2011, participating in the **MeeGo** project, and then
spent 2012 working from A Coruña's offices, working on **WebKit** and
other technologies. I enjoyed it a lot, got really attached to the
people there —some of them I call friends now—, and grew a lot
professionally.

Igalia is organized in a flat structure, where we take more
responsibilities than just coding, and where the ultimate step is to
become a partner. However, I currently have the feeling that I want to
focus more on the technical side of things, to gain more expertise, and
that would be too complicated without neglecting these other
responsibilities —the kind of responsibilities that take time and
energy. Then, being honest with my colleagues, the responsible thing was
leaving.

I have only started looking for new opportunities since I announced my
decision, so things are still a bit unclear. We will be quite probably
leaving Spain and heading North: we would like to go to The Netherlands,
but we don't discard anything in advance.

If your company needs a **Software Engineer**, chances are I could be of
help, so take a look at my profile in
[LinkedIn](http://es.linkedin.com/in/simonpena/en "Simon Pena at LinkedIn"),
and don't hesitate to ask me for my CV or other details. And, if you're
so kind, please pass the word and help me find a new cool place!
