There's a considerable amount of information about flashing a HTC Tattoo
/ HTC Click using Windows, even with one-step processes [1]. However, as
the process only requires using the Android SDK, it can be performed in
all the platforms the SDK has been ported to.

We'll follow the next steps:

-   Create a Goldcard
-   Get root access
-   Flash a recovery image
-   Flash the updates

First of all, download an up to date recovery image [2], and get a zip
with all the binaries we'll need [1]

CREATE GOLDCARD
---------------

A Goldcard is a specially prepared SD memory card for Android
smartphones that allows to flash RUU files with a different CID to a
particular phone. To create one, we need:

1.  A SD card formatted FAT32
2.  Get a device ID number

        $ adb shell
        $ cat /sys/class/mmc_host/mmc1/mmc1:*/cid

3.  Get the goldcard image:
    1.  Reverse the previously obtained number at [GoldCard hex reverse
        page](http://hexrev.soaa.me/)
    2.  Request your goldcard image: [HTC Goldcard
        generator](http://psas.revskills.de/?q=goldcard)

4.  Flash image to the SD card

        $ sudo dd bs=512 if=/path/to/goldcard.img of=/device/of/sdcard

    <p>
    \# Get your sdcard device from dmesg, disk utility, or your tool of
    choice. Mine was /dev/sdb1. Don't 'dd' to your PC's primary disk!

GET ROOT ACCESS
---------------

We need root access to load the kernel module needed to flash the
recovery image. To gain root access, we'll be using an exploit. (This
part of the process has been adapted from [4])

First of all, we'll connect to the device, and create a directory to
store the needed binaries:

    $ adb shell
    $ mkdir /data/local/bin

Then we copy the binaries to the recently created directory:

    $ adb push m7 /data/local/bin

    $ adb push su /data/local/bin

    $ adb push flash_image /data/local/bin

    $ adb push kernel_module /data/local/bin

- M7 Exploit

Once you've uploaded the m7 binary to the device, you need to use it so
it gains root access:

\$ while ./m7 ; do : ; done

After a while, you should get the '\#' indicating that you're root now.

- su and flash\_image

### FLASH RECOVERY

- Put recovery in sdcard

- Flash recovery

FLASH UPDATES
-------------

- Put zips in sdcard

- From recovery
