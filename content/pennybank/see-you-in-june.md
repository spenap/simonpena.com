I haven't typed a single line of code since the Easter Week Holidays.
Besides my daily job, I should be finishing some assignments I've been
given, so this personal project has been pushed back in my priorities
stack. I'm not going to give up so easily: I think it's just a matter of
time, and in the worst case I will be back here in June.It's a pitty,
because the application is very close to a *functional-enough* state. Or
maybe it is better this way, as I feel the urge to come back developing
as soon as possible, instead of thinking that "*as it works right now,
there's no need to keep working*".
